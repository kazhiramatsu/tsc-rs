# Vendored TypeScript Pin

- npm package: `typescript`
- version: `6.0.3`
- source: `oracle/node_modules/typescript`
- `_tsc.js` sha256:
  `1c59e77a54b186ec43fa7f3e0d3c4bb15ca5eb5ba43e96b1d3a267139eddd3e3`

The vendored implementation lives under
`vendor/typescript-6.0.3/lib/`. It contains `_tsc.js`,
`typescript.js`, `typescript.d.ts`, `diagnosticMessages.json`, and the
108 layered `lib*.d.ts` files used by the oracle and future codegen.

The conformance corpus is vendored under
`ts-tests/tests/cases/conformance/`.

The upstream `compiler`, `project`, and `projects` test trees are vendored
byte-for-byte under `ts-tests/tests/cases/` from TypeScript commit
`050880ce59e30b356b686bd3144efe24f875ebc8`. Their exact Git tree IDs, blob
inventory digests, file counts, byte counts, and executable modes are pinned
in `vendor/typescript-6.0.3/test-suites-pin.v1.json`. The harness integration
contract recursively verifies every entry; the three trees are not sampled or
filtered. This is an inventory-integrity contract: it does not execute those
upstream suites or claim that the compiler passes them.
