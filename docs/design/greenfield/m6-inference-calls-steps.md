# M6: inference + overload completion — steps

Parent design: checker-key-functions.md §2 (inference) and §3 (the
re-run machinery); core-interfaces.md §6 (InferenceInfo contract).
Prerequisite: M5 gate green. This milestone REPLACES exactly one
M4 stub (`infer_type_arguments`) and activates the CheckMode plumbing
M4 ported inert.

**START PRECONDITION (external review 2026-07-14,
[definition-of-done.md](definition-of-done.md) checkpoint table): a
speculation scoped-transaction API must exist BEFORE any stage here
lands.** Today the links contract is only "speculative writes panic"
(links.rs assert_writable) and speculation_depth is raised solely by
its unit tests; candidate trials during overload/inference need a
production `begin_speculation()` guard whose drop/abort rolls back
the contextual/inference stacks, temporary caches, and collected
diagnostics, with commit-on-success — plus failed-candidate rollback
tests. The full state-surface inventory the transaction must cover is
Stage 7.0t below. Design and land that before 7.1; the
alternative — candidate state leaking through links or blanket
panics mid-resolution — is the exact failure mode the M4 5.7a
deferred re-check protocol only papered over for calls.

Gate: full gate per stage — inference moves 2345/2322/2769/2339
together, never call fixtures alone. (The original "T0 ≥ 58%"
calibration line here was superseded at close — see Final gate.)

## Stage 7.0t: speculation scoped-transaction — STATE-SURFACE INVENTORY [M]

Spec input for the `begin_speculation()` transaction (the START
PRECONDITION above). Transcribed from the 2026-07-19 M4 review
(m4-review-2026-07-19.md 付録A, items B34/B35) — the engine-band
agents' full-state audit. Legend: (a) = today's Unsupported-unwind
restoration, (b) = M6 rollback requirement, (c) = residue risk.

**Already closed by the `m6/0-start-bar` slice (read the code, not
the risk column, for these):** A1 relation-key forcing
(get_relation_key is fallible and constraint-forcing; the `*`
broadest-key Maybe recheck is live), A4 resolved_return_type
(`seal_signature_return_type`: `??=` + speculation assert), B10
(union_property_cache / subtype_reduction_cache /
set_symbol_is_discriminant / ty_mut_cached_equivalent_base_type all
assert speculation_depth == 0), B15 (parameters of context-sensitive
signatures never cache their type).

### A. Transient stacks (must be at entry depth after any unwind — all in UnwindSnapshot unless noted)

| Field (state.rs) | today | M6 need | risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| `resolution_targets/results/property_names` (659-661) + `resolution_start` (664) | every pusher pops via captured-result pattern; snapshot-checked | save/restore lengths + `resolution_start`; results VALUES below the mark are mutated by cycle flagging — truncate is enough since entries above mark are popped | LOW |
| `contextual_type_nodes/types/is_cache` (502-504) | push/pop paired | truncate to mark | LOW |
| `inference_context_nodes/contexts` (509-510) | exists-but-empty (M6 payload pending) | THE new M6 stack — define rollback with it | — |
| `contextual_binding_patterns` (495) | paired | truncate | LOW |
| `awaited_type_stack` (474) | paired | truncate | LOW |
| `active_type_mappers(+caches)` (306-307) | pushed frames popped on Err (instantiate.rs:1091-1096) | truncate stack; ALSO port `clearActiveMapperCaches` on inference fixing; entries in SURVIVING outer frames computed during a failed candidate stay structurally true — but under a mutable inference mapper they are stale unless cleared | **HIGH** |
| `variance_handler_stack` (303) | popped on Err (engine.rs:1692-1699) | truncate | LOW |
| `class_interface_declared_in_progress` (320), `type_parameter_defaults_in_progress` (324) | popped before `?` | truncate | LOW |
| `flow_loop_stack` (527) + `flow_loop_start` (521) | paired; snapshot-checked | truncate/restore | LOW |
| `shared_flow` (336) | truncate-before-`?` (flow.rs:317) — **NOT snapshot-checked** | truncate to mark; add to UnwindSnapshot | MED |
| `reduce_label_overrides` (343) | restore-before-return (flow.rs:1856-1863) — **NOT snapshot-checked** | snapshot map or forbid across speculation | MED |
| `exhaustive_switch_computing` (551) | remove-before-`?` (narrow.rs:2352) — **NOT snapshot-checked** | must be empty across the boundary | MED |
| RelationChecker maybe stack (engine.rs:707-720) | per-call local struct; Err arm pops its frame's keys (1707-1718); every early return precedes the pushes | nothing — cannot leak by construction | NONE |

### B. Counters / cursors / flags

`speculation_depth` (203): the transaction's own guard — RAII
increment/decrement. `instantiation_depth` (311): restored on Err;
snapshot-checked. `instantiation_count` (312): monotone per element,
reset at the three entry points (check.rs:344 / check.rs:1764 /
expr.rs:102 = tsc 86551/86921/80965) — do NOT restore on rollback
(tsc doesn't). `inline_level` (539): NOT snapshot-checked.
`in_variance_computation` (295) / `variance_type_parameter` (291):
save/restore exists. `flow_analysis_disabled` (331): one-way latch
even in tsc — leave. `is_inference_partially_blocked` (247):
M6-owned, part of the transaction. `suggestion_count` (454): **must
be snapshot/restored or consumption-gated under speculation** — tsc
consumes the did-you-mean budget only on reporting paths.

### C. Caches — permanent-truth (keep across failed speculation, keyed structurally)

`relations` (5 maps + enum_relation) — keep (A1 key collisions are
FIXED); entries referencing speculation-minted types stay internally
consistent (types are permanent interned objects; tsc doesn't roll
relation caches back either). `subtype_reduction_cache`,
`cached_types`, `tables.instantiation_*`, `links.alias_instantiations`,
`links.union_property_cache`, `Signature.instantiations`/
`erased_signature_cache`/`optional_call_signature_cache`/
`isolated_signature_type`, `decorator_context_override_type_cache`,
`undefined_properties`, `evolving_array_types`/`final_array_types`,
`flow_loop_caches`, `flow_node_reachable`, `last_flow_node(+reachable)`,
`switch_types_cache`/`exhaustive_switch_cache`/`effects_signature_cache`/
`resolved_type_predicates`, deferred-global memos,
`init_global_type_probes`, `jsx_implicit_import_containers`,
`js_assignment_containment_indexes`, `unresolved_package_root_cache`,
`merged_symbols` — all compute-once truths; no rollback needed
PROVIDED no M6 inference-placeholder type can be an input key (in tsc
the only inference-sensitive cache is the active-mapper cache).
**Verify this property for each new M6 cache.**

Links tables: write-once/protocol slots; the four Resolving-sentinel
protocols each have paired Err-reverts (variances / simplified /
resolvedSignature call protocol / aliasTarget) — verified. Late-bind
revert annotate.rs:3460-3467; members retracts
annotate.rs:3117/3263/4360/5354. The A4/B10 discipline bypasses are
CLOSED (asserts in place), so "no permanent writes under speculation"
now holds mechanically — any new raw cache field must join the assert
net before 7.1 lands.

### D. Diagnostics sinks (transaction must truncate)

`diagnostics` (570) — truncate to mark (push-dedupe is order-safe
under truncation). `visible_global_diagnostics` (575).
`partially_checked_ranges` (580) + `partial_check_records` (584) — a
speculative containment permanently marks a range (affects
@ts-expect-error exemption) → must roll back.
`elaborated_satisfies_expressions` (587), the five `potential_*`
per-file accumulators (431-435) — speculative pushes must roll back
or double-drain. `deferred_nodes` (420) — tsc DOES still check nodes
registered under speculative checkMode; verify against tsc
checkNodeDeferred before deciding to roll back. `suggestion_count` —
see B.

### E. Interners / arenas (append-only, never rolled back — garbage is safe)

`tables` types (object-flag memos:
COULD_CONTAIN_TYPE_VARIABLES_COMPUTED / IS_UNKNOWN_LIKE_UNION_COMPUTED
written only after the fallible region — verified;
IDENTICAL_BASE_TYPE_CALCULATED is the exception = review B1, still
open), `signatures` (196; the A4 raw-field bypass is closed),
`members` (197; staged-publication in-place mutation has Err retract
twins), `mappers` (262), `widening_contexts` (482),
`inference_context_arena` (added at 7.1: context MUTATIONS also
deliberately survive failed trials — chooseOverload reuses the SAME
context across its re-run, 76842-76844, so trial-time candidate
accumulation is tsc semantics, not rollback debt; the
inference-context NODE STACK stays A-class checkpoint-managed).

### Additional M6-start requirements (review B35)

- Port `clearActiveMapperCaches` (tsc 73624-73629, invoked from
  getInferredType 69310) WITH the inference port.
- Decide ONE revert-twin convention:
  `revert_node_enum_values_computed` (links.rs:861-864) asserts
  speculation_depth while every other revert twin deliberately does
  not — an unwind DURING speculation panics there via
  evaluate.rs:112. Resolve before 7.1.
- Extend the speculation_depth assert net to any remaining raw
  Signature fields and the D-sinks above as the transaction lands.
- `suggestion_count` budget needs rollback (see B).

Field line numbers are review-HEAD (43432368) state.rs coordinates —
re-derive when the struct shifts; the FIELD LIST is the contract.

Commit: `m6 7.0t: speculation transaction` (API + rollback tests
BEFORE 7.1).

**LANDED (this slice) — decisions of record:**
- API: `begin_speculation()` → `SpeculationCheckpoint` +
  `commit_speculation`/`rollback_speculation` + the `speculate`
  closure wrapper (speculate.rs; checkpoint is `#[must_use]` with a
  debug drop-guard, LIFO-asserted). Boundary ordering rule: the
  wrapper rolls back BEFORE re-propagating Err, so outer Err-revert
  twins always fire at entry depth.
- Revert-twin convention (B35, resolved): twins never assert
  speculation_depth — a revert restores pre-write state, always
  legal. `revert_node_enum_values_computed` lost its assert AND its
  depth parameter (now matches every other twin's signature); the
  evaluate.rs:112 panic path is gone, and twins that fire INSIDE a
  speculative region (depth > 0) are correct by design.
- D sinks are TRANSACTION-managed (truncate/restore on rollback,
  keep on commit) — no asserts on sink pushes. deferred_nodes
  VERIFY item resolved: KEEP across rollback (checkNodeDeferred
  86899-86908 registers unconditionally). instantiation_count and
  the flow_analysis_disabled latch also deliberately survive.
- Assert-net extension (B35): the three raw Signature caches —
  `instantiations`, `erased_signature_cache`,
  `optional_call_signature_cache` — now assert depth == 0 at their
  write sites (same message as links assert_writable). The net is
  the 7.4 WIRING INVENTORY: when live trials exercise a site that
  is a category-C permanent truth (tsc writes it during trials),
  relax THAT site with the evidence in hand — no blanket relaxation
  here.
- exhaustive_switch_computing: begin debug-asserts empty (the
  inventory claim) and the checkpoint clone-restores it anyway;
  reduce_label_overrides is clone-snapshot/restored.
- active_type_mappers(+caches): truncate-to-mark only; surviving-
  frame cache staleness under a mutable inference mapper stays 7.3's
  clearActiveMapperCaches (tsc clears at fixing, not on candidate
  failure).
- B34 census widening: UnwindSnapshot (check.rs) now also checks
  shared_flow, reduce_label_overrides, exhaustive_switch_computing,
  inline_level (file-end baseline zeros included).

## Stage 7.0: canaries [P]

Snapshot 40 fixtures — actual corpus paths:
types/typeRelationships/typeInference/**,
expressions/functionCalls/typeArgumentInference*.ts,
expressions/contextualTyping/**, overload-heavy
(es6/templates/taggedTemplate*, expressions/functionCalls/**).
Same snapshot procedure as M5 6.0.

Commit: `m6 7.0: inference canary list`.

## Stage 7.1: inference data model [M]

`InferenceInfo` / `InferenceContext` from core-interfaces §6 PLUS
three fields §6 omits (fixed there too, this list is authoritative):
`intra_expression_inference_sites` (68286/68290 — populated by
object/array-literal/JSX checking, DRAINED inside the fixing mapper
before is_fixed is set, cleared by checkExpressionWithContextualType
80557), `inferred_type_parameters` (80804 — consumed by
chooseOverload via getSignatureInstantiation, stage 7.4), and the
`outer_return_mapper` cache slot (createOuterReturnMapper 63385).
Also: `top_level`, `is_fixed` (SET exclusively inside
makeFixingMapperForContext 68258 when the fixing mapper resolves a
type parameter on demand — it is mapper machinery, not an
inferFromTypes arm), `implied_arity`, `contra_candidates`, the
`InferencePriority` bit set (generated), the fixing/non-fixing
mapper pair (both Deferred mappers), and `compare_types`. Context
creation: `createInferenceContext` (68238);
`cloneInferenceContext` (68241) serves the OUTER-context NoDefault
mapper inside inferTypeArguments (75951) and createOuterReturnMapper
— the chooseOverload RE-RUN reuses the SAME context (76842-76844;
cloning there would discard fixed inferences — the failure-modes
row 2 is the correct statement).

Commit: `m6 7.1: InferenceInfo/InferenceContext`.

**LANDED (this slice) — decisions of record:**
- Contexts are arena-allocated (`inference_context_arena`,
  E-class — see 7.0t list) with `InferenceContextId` as tsc object
  identity; the 47401-47402 node stack's payload swapped from the
  uninhabited placeholder to the id (stack stays A-class).
- `InferenceInfo.type_parameter` is the TypeParameter TYPE (TypeId),
  NOT its symbol — mapper sources compare type identities
  (getMappedType 63341). core-interfaces §6's SymbolId sketch is
  corrected in place.
- Deferred mappers: `DeferredMapperTargets::{InferenceFixing,
  InferenceNonFixing}(ctx)` dispatch over the context's CREATION-TIME
  capture (`mapper_sources`/`mapper_infos` — tsc's
  makeDeferredTypeMapper sources snapshot and thunk-captured info
  objects, 68258-68278). AMENDED post-review: infos live in their own
  E-class arena (`InferenceInfoId` on CheckerState) so they carry tsc
  object identity — the fixing thunk's isFixed test-and-set rides the
  captured info while clearCachedInferences/getInferredType read the
  LIVE slots, making mergeInferences (80836 `target[i] = source[i]`,
  a slot-id rewrite at 7.4) tsc-exact by construction, including the
  post-merge split (detached capture stays fixed; the fresh live row
  starts unfixed, reopening the 68710 candidate gate). The 7.1
  dynamic-lookup equivalence proof is superseded; the split is pinned
  by test (fixing_dispatch_consults_creation_capture_after_slot_
  replacement).
- `compare_types` is a closed enum (`CompareTypesFn`); only the
  default `Assignable` is constructible until the 7.5 head rebuild
  routes the relation-frame worker (64507) and M8 the conditional
  infer-source context (66368).
- undefined-exactness: `candidates`/`contra_candidates`/`priority`/
  `intra_expression_inference_sites`/`inferred_type_parameters` are
  Option (present ⇒ tsc-created; present candidate vecs are
  non-empty); `implied_arity: Option<usize>`.
- Frontier stubs (escapes owner=M6): `infer_types` → 7.2,
  `get_inferred_type` → 7.3. Production-unreachable: every
  production pushInferenceContext site still passes None until 7.4.
- Consumer wrappers activated 1:1 this slice:
  checkExpressionWithContextualType ORs Inferential for Some
  contexts + clears (not drains) sites (80566-80569);
  instantiateContextualType's real body + instantiateInstantiableTypes
  (73459-73470, NEW port) + hasInferenceCandidatesOrDefault +
  context_flags parameter (only getApparentTypeOfContextualType
  passes real flags; 78813/80570/80726 pass void 0);
  getContextualThisParameterType's 72666 mapper read;
  contextuallyCheckFunctionExpressionOrObjectLiteralMethod's 79174
  mapper instantiation (its Inferential arm = 7.4 escape);
  instantiateTypeWithSingleGenericCallSignature's M4 `unreachable!`
  replaced by the live 80753-80766 probe (getSingleSignature
  75896-75909 NEW port) with the generic body a 7.4 escape.
- Gate evidence: canaries byte-stable at baseline (T0 141/740,
  FP=0, FN=599, mismatches=33); 725 checker tests (13 new pins:
  creation shape, clone independence/flag-OR, inferred-part filter,
  deferred dispatch identity+frontier, fixing order
  (clear-while-unfixed → fix → resolve), sites lazy-add/drain/
  mid-drain-unwind/undrained-clear, outer-return-mapper merge+cache,
  returnMapper branch incl. the 73453 boolean-literal filter,
  Signature-branch non-fixing consult, arena-vs-stack rollback).

## Stage 7.2: inferTypes / inferFromTypes [M]

The candidate collector (68637/68646), ported arm by arm in tsc
order, priorities attached exactly as the source sets them: the
NoInfer gate FIRST (`isNoInferType` 60427 — Substitution type with
Unknown constraint aborts all inference; the NoInfer intrinsic→
Substitution mapping must exist for it to fire), identical
types, unions/intersections both sides (the naked-type-variable
ordering), literals, template literals + string mappings
(inferTypesFromTemplateLiteralType 68575), index/keyof, conditional
types (inferToConditionalType 69011), mapped-type homomorphic
inference (inferToMappedType 68972; ReverseMapped needs
createReverseMappedType 68398 + getTypeOfReverseMappedSymbol +
inferReverseMappedType 68441 + the mapped-type accessors),
object/signature structural inference
(`inferFromProperties`, `inferFromSignatures` with bivariance rules),
array/tuple element inference, contra-candidate collection at
contravariant positions, `top_level` cleared at CANDIDATE-RECORD
time via `isTypeParameterAtTopLevel(originalTarget, …)` (68732 — not
a flag threaded down the descent; threading one diverges),
priority comparison (LOWER wins; equal priorities accumulate).

ARM DISPOSITIONS (same discipline as M3 4.6): the conditional-type
and mapped/ReverseMapped arms are DORMANT for as long as M4 5.1 left
those type kinds as M8-ledgered stubs — port the arms against
source, ledger them dormant, and pin them when the constructors go
live (M8 at the latest; earlier if M4 chose to port them). The
template-literal arm is LIVE (M3 builds the type kind); the
string-mapping arm goes live with M4 5.1/5.2 (`Uppercase<...>` is an
intrinsic ALIAS reference — needs generic alias instantiation, which
M3's annotation path lacks).

Verify per commit against canaries; expect 2345-family movement only
after 7.4 wires results in.

Commit(s): `m6 7.2a-d: inferFromTypes arms`.

**Decisions of record (7.2a-d, 2026-07-20):**

- **Walker shape:** the closure family lives on `InferTypesWalker`
  (one per inferTypes invocation; state dies with Err unwinds —
  durable writes only through the E-class info arena). Closed enums
  stand in for tsc's function references: `TypeMatcher` (matching
  predicates), `InferAction` (invokeOnce actions) — the CompareTypesFn
  precedent.
- **Dormant-arm depth:** Conditional and Mapped have NO TypeData/
  ObjectFlags constructors before M8, so the deepest portable point is
  a named escape at the BODY (`infer_to_conditional_type`,
  `infer_from_generic_mapped_types`, the Mapped-target block inside
  `infer_from_object_types`) with the dispatch + invokeOnce wiring
  live; isTypeParameterAtTopLevel's depth<3 Conditional probe
  likewise. Re-cut against source and pin when M8 lands the nodes.
- **Stale-shortcut fix (watch-pattern hit):**
  `infer_types_from_template_literal_type`'s equal-texts path carried
  an M3-era "getBaseConstraintOrType is the identity" comment and
  compared the RAW pair; falsified once M4 made instantiable
  placeholder types constructible. Fixed to 68577's both-sides base
  comparison; probe `rbase` (`a${number}` vs `a${T extends number}`)
  pins `number` (the shortcut wrapped it into `` `${number}` ``).
- **isValidBigIntString split:** the scan half is
  `tsrs2_syntax::scan_big_int_string` (the probe scanner skips trivia
  inside `scan()`, so start-adjacency checks stand in for tsc's
  skipTrivia:false trivia tokens; the scanner radix-normalizes
  binary/octal at scan time where tsc defers to parsePseudoBigInt —
  one conversion either way); the checker owns the roundTrip
  comparison through expr.rs's parsePseudoBigInt. The structural.rs
  bigint-placeholder escape retired into the live arm.
- **JS-slice fidelity (probe-tuple.mjs):** `slice_tuple_type` clamps
  inverted ranges to empty exactly as JS `Array.prototype.slice`
  (pre-fix panic on sources shorter than the target's fixed parts);
  trailing-slice bounds go through `js_slice_bounds` (negative ends
  count from the end). The from-end reading of skip > arity is NOT
  modeled (unreachable today) — **7.4's impliedArity wiring must
  re-audit**, and the both-variadic middle arm is gated on
  `implied_arity` (None until 7.4 records it).
- **tsc-crash deviation row 4 (m8-readiness.md):** an undefined
  middle slice meeting a type-variable rest target TypeErrors in
  vendored tsc (`f<T extends [any, any], U>(x: [...T, ...U[]])` on a
  short tuple). `infer_from_middle_slice` skips the harmless
  variable-free shape (tsc's couldContainTypeVariables early return)
  and reports the crash shape as a recovery-class escape
  (max_recovery 112 → 113).
- **applyToParameterTypes/applyToReturnTypes** are walker methods
  hard-bound to their single 69199/69202 callbacks; 7.4's
  instantiateSignatureInContextOf caller (75960) runs OUTSIDE the
  walker and needs its own state-level application with an inferTypes
  callback — do not widen these.
- **getBaseSignature** landed with `Signature.base_signature_cache`
  in the 7.0t speculation assert net (erased-cache twin discipline).
  The net asserts depth 0: once 7.4 runs inferFromSignatures inside
  chooseOverload's speculative trials, the base/erased cache writes
  trip it on the first generic source signature whose cache is cold —
  resolve the write discipline THERE (pre-warm, reclassify, or a
  depth-aware write); do not delete the assert (7.2 post-review).
- **getUnmatchedProperty** moved from the RelationChecker down to
  CheckerState and grew the matchDiscriminantProperties unit arm
  (68470-68479, used only by typesDefinitelyUnrelated's
  source→target direction); the relation path delegates with false.

## Stage 7.3: resolving inferences [M]

- `getCovariantInference` (69263) — the FULL widen-literals condition
  from checker-key §2.1 including `hasPrimitiveConstraint`,
  `isTypeParameterAtTopLevelInReturnType`, and the
  PriorityImpliesCombination union-vs-common-supertype split
  (Subtype relation from M3 4.8 feeds getCommonSupertype).
- `getContravariantInference` (69260, intersection-vs-common-subtype
  split — `getCommonSubtype` 67662 is scheduled nowhere earlier; port
  it here alongside M3's getCommonSupertype).
- `getInferredType` (69271) — the constraint clamp EXACTLY as the
  checker-key §2.2 skeleton: ReturnType-priority inferences FILTER to
  the compatible part; others go never → fallback → instantiated
  constraint. Defaults instantiate with the backreference mapper
  (63381) merged with the nonFixingMapper;
  NoDefault/AnyDefault flags honored (NoDefault → silentNeverType,
  which carries NonInferrableType so it can never become a candidate).
- CACHE WIRING + INVALIDATION (the milestone table's "generics
  instantiation caches" — otherwise unscheduled):
  `signature.instantiations` keyed by getTypeListId (59902-59910);
  getInferredType calls `clearActiveMapperCaches()` (73624, at 69310)
  to invalidate M4 5.2's active-mapper instantiation caches;
  `reverseHomomorphicMappedCache` (68387); `clearCachedInferences`
  (68279) on every candidate/topLevel mutation. Stale
  non-fixing-mapper instantiations across candidate accumulation are
  a silent-wrong-type source — port the invalidation discipline, not
  just the caches.

Commit: `m6 7.3: covariant/contravariant inference + clamp`.

**Decisions of record (7.3, 2026-07-20):**

- **Span corrections against vendored 6.0.3:** getInferredType is
  69271-69313 (this section's 69271/69310 call-site refs stand;
  the clamp is 69295-69309, clearActiveMapperCaches at 69310).
  The "instantiations keyed by getTypeListId (59902-59910)" bullet's
  span is getSignatureInstantiationWithoutFillingInTypeArguments;
  getTypeListId itself is 60128.
- **Cache wiring mostly predated this stage:**
  `signature.instantiations` + getTypeListId +
  getSignatureInstantiation/createSignatureInstantiation landed at
  M4 5.2 (instantiate.rs, with the 7.0t depth-0 assert net over the
  map writes). New at 7.3: `clear_active_mapper_caches` (73624-73628)
  invoked on every resolution MISS (69310) — pinned by test incl.
  the no-clear-on-memo-hit distinction.
  `reverseHomomorphicMappedCache` (47333/68388) has NO portable
  consumer: its only reader/writer inferTypeForHomomorphicMappedType
  is unported, called only from the 7.2 Mapped-arm escape — the
  cache lands WITH the consumer at M8 (grep-provable absence, no pin
  needed).
- **checker-key §2.2 skeleton deviations (source wins):** the
  preferCovariantType contra clause is `some(contraCandidates,
  cov→t)` — the skeleton's prose `all(...)` is wrong; the sibling
  `every(...)` clause groups per JS precedence as `(other !==
  inference && constraintOf(other.tp) !== inf.tp) || every(
  other.candidates, t→cov)` with helper-`every`'s vacuous-true on
  undefined arrays (_tsc.js:80) and the `&&` short-circuit keeping
  the constraint probe OFF the row itself; the clamp's filter arm
  keys on priority EQUALITY (`=== ReturnType`), not a mask test.
  All pinned by unit tests (veto/control pair, filter-vs-constraint
  pair, fallback-to-contravariant).
- **Memo write order is load-bearing:** the pre-clamp write (69296
  `inference.inferredType = inferredType || default`) lands BEFORE
  constraint/default instantiation so re-entrant resolution through
  the non-fixing mapper memo-hits instead of recursing; the clamp
  overwrites at 69309. The backreference mapper (63381) shields
  forward slots during default instantiation — pinned:
  `resolution_forward_default_collapses_to_unknown_via_backreference`
  (forward default → unknown, non-fixing NEVER consulted for the
  forward slot).
- **getDefaultTypeArgumentType** was already ported at M4
  (fillMissingTypeArguments's shared default) — reused via
  pub(crate), span header corrected to 69314-69316; NOT duplicated.
- **hasPrimitiveConstraint Conditional arm** (69242,
  getDefaultConstraintOfConditionalType) is a named M8 escape — the
  7.2 dormant-arm discipline (no Conditional constructors before
  M8).
- **Corpus-neutral by construction:** every production
  pushInferenceContext site still passes None until 7.4, so T0/2xxx
  integers are byte-identical (53.9756% / 76.0534%, FP=0) — the
  stage's verification weight rides the 15 new unit pins; the 7.1
  stub-frontier pins were rewritten to assert LIVE resolution
  (unknown/string results, live-slot memo reads after slot
  replacement).

## Stage 7.4: inferTypeArguments + the re-run [M]

- `inferTypeArguments` (75938): the contextual-return pre-inference
  is TWO passes, not one (75944-75961 — the piece most
  first-implementation quality gaps traced to; checker-key §2.3 had
  them conflated, corrected there): (a1) ReturnType-priority
  inference against the contextual type instantiated through
  `cloneInferenceContext(outerContext, NoDefault)`'s mapper, skipped
  when isFromBindingPattern, generic contextual signatures routed
  through getSignatureInstantiationWithoutFillingInTypeArguments;
  (a2) a FRESH `returnContext = createInferenceContext(...)` (75957)
  doing priority-None inference from the contextual type under
  `createOuterReturnMapper(outerContext)` (63385) — `context.
  returnMapper` comes from cloneInferredPartOfContext of THAT
  context (75960), NOT from the ReturnType-priority pass. Outer
  context comes from `getInferenceContext` (73599) walking the
  inference-context NODE STACK — push/pop it alongside M4 5.5's
  contextual-type stack. Then PHASE (b) per-argument inference via
  `checkExpressionWithContextualType` (80557) + `getTypeAtPosition`,
  rest args via `getSpreadArgumentType` (76002).
- DELETE the M4 stub; `chooseOverload`'s inference path now runs the
  real thing, INCLUDING the SkipContextSensitive /
  SkipGenericFunctions first pass and the NORMAL-mode RE-RUN before
  committing a candidate (checker-key §3.2 — the plumbing M4 laid;
  the re-run reuses the SAME InferenceContext, stage 7.1).
- The SkipGenericFunctions CONSUMER side (scheduled nowhere else —
  without it higher-order generic inference degrades silently):
  `skippedGenericFunction` (80816, sets SkippedGenericFunction on the
  context), checkExpression's higher-order path (80760-80815:
  getUniqueTypeParameters 80843, hasOverlappingInferences,
  mergeInferences, `context.inferredTypeParameters = ...` 80804,
  instantiateSignatureInContextOf 75910), and chooseOverload's
  consumption via `getSignatureInstantiation(candidate, ...,
  inferenceContext.inferredTypeParameters)` (76844). mergeInferences
  is a LIVE-slot id rewrite (`inferences[i] = source_slot`) — the
  mapper capture keeps the creation-time infos, so tsc's post-merge
  split (detached capture fixed, fresh live row unfixed) holds by
  construction (7.1 post-review identity model, pinned by test).
- Context-sensitive argument detection (`isContextSensitive` 63832)
  and the deferred body interaction (M4's driver already defers
  bodies; the re-run is what types their parameters).
- Re-entry protocol (M4-review F7): get_resolved_signature's exit
  write is wrote_sentinel-conditional where tsc 77500-77507 restores
  links.resolvedSignature UNCONDITIONALLY per frame (result, or the
  prior cached value mid-fixpoint) — a re-entrant mid-fixpoint frame
  can leak an inner failure stash over the outer frame's Resolving
  sentinel. Re-derive the port protocol against 77500-77507 when the
  re-run lands.
- Speculation-assert carry-in (7.2 post-review): getBaseSignature /
  getErasedSignature cache writes assert speculation depth 0
  (instantiate.rs, the 7.0t net), and chooseOverload trials run
  inference — hence inferFromSignatures — under begin_speculation.
  Decide the write discipline before wiring the re-run; see the 7.2
  decisions block.
- Observed while pinning slice 5 (2026-07-20): under
  exactOptionalPropertyTypes, overload selection accepts a candidate
  whose optional-property undefined-vs-string mismatch the
  single-signature path correctly rejects (probed: declared
  `{ a: number; c?: undefined }` argument against overloads
  `{ a; c?: string }` → number / `unknown` → string — port picks #1,
  tsc picks #2). An applicability-relation eOPT gap in
  choose_overload; re-probe when this stage replaces the selection
  loop.

Commit: `m6 7.4: inferTypeArguments + chooseOverload re-run`.

**Decisions of record (7.4a-d, 2026-07-20):**

- **Speculation discipline (the 7.0t/7.2 carry-in, RESOLVED):
  candidate trials are NOT speculation-wrapped.** tsc shares every
  trial-time write with the surrounding check: inference contexts are
  E-class and deliberately reused across the re-run, signature
  instantiation caches are structural truths, and argument links
  memos are legit once-only. Blanket wrapping is untenable anyway —
  legit links writes during phase-b argument checks would trip
  assert_writable. The 7.0t depth-0 assert net stands UNTOUCHED
  (nothing trips at depth 0; the predicted base/erased trips never
  materialize because trials never raise the depth). speculate()
  remains the harness for port-specific probes and M8 seams.
- **F7 (re-derived against 77500-77507):** the exit write restores
  the frame-ENTRY value on every non-memoizing exit. A re-entrant
  frame (entry value = the outer Resolving sentinel) restores THAT
  sentinel via a dedicated links twin
  (restore_node_resolved_signature_call_resolving) instead of leaking
  an inner stash; the Err channel mirrors the discipline. The one
  deliberate deviation stands: a loop-clean fresh frame keeps a
  COMPLETED failure stash (Resolving-gated revert) — tsc memoizes the
  failure face. A resolvingSignature RESULT skips the exit write
  entirely (77504) — the sentinel is load-bearing for the 72918/77616
  skip-arm consumers; a sentinel left by a resolution the port later
  contains can survive to file end, where the debug Resolving census
  would flag it (accepted risk — none observed across the corpus).
- **Fabrication wall (the FP=0 debugging round; every rule
  tsc-probed):** (1) getContextuallyTypedParameterType's [INFER M6]
  apparent-type escape RETIRED — tsc falls through to undefined and
  the implicit-any face is the REAL outcome (a probe-pushed `any`
  contextual burns ContextChecked with no assignment and the
  parameter pins exactly like tsc). (2) T2 display containment runs
  the implementation probe's argument checks (burn/pin side effects)
  BEFORE re-propagating — tsc's sink order has probe pushes precede
  the main diagnostic, so parity improves. (3) checkJsxExpression
  threads checkMode (74494) — the NORMAL hardcode dropped
  SkipContextSensitive during trials and pinned type parameters via
  premature fixing. (4) Deferred FUNCTION-kind nodes re-checking
  under a contained call resolution (range-contained AND an ancestor
  call-like's resolvedSignature reverted to Vacant) skip and extend
  the containment — a contextless re-check fabricates 7006/18046
  rows tsc never emits. The rule is deliberately narrow: the
  kind-blind and Vacant-blind cuts each regressed accepted
  identities (164 and 2) and the set-ratchet caught both live.
- **Selection-loop fidelity finds:** getSignatureInstantiation now
  reads isInJSFile(candidate.declaration) on BOTH type-argument
  sources (76821 — the stub era passed false; dormant JS-file
  deviation). getDeclarationModifierFlagsFromSymbol's synthetic arm
  gained the 17446 staticModifier OR-in + the Prototype arm — a
  synthesized mixin protected STATIC otherwise walked the
  instance-protected path (mixinAccessModifiers 2446 FP).
  isContextSensitive's JsxAttributes/JsxAttribute arms went live
  (63853-63857; the 5.5f-era constant-false was a stale stub).
  getObjectTypeInstantiation's SingleSignatureType arm (63496-63498)
  replaced the "unconstructible before M6" assert — 7.4a's
  contextual re-key constructs them.
- **Carry-in audits closed:** the eOPT overload-selection divergence
  no longer reproduces after the rebuild (probe74j; pinned). The
  impliedArity re-audit found the 7.2d from-end slice window
  (endSkipCount > arity) REACHABLE via 69114's `endLength +
  sourceArity - impliedArity`; sliceTupleType now models JS's
  negative-end re-read `max(2*len - skip, 0)` (probe74k
  reachability; pinned).
- **Higher-order frontier (7.4c):** the 80751-80815 path is fully
  live but corpus-neutral — its RESULT still contains at
  compareSignaturesRelated's generic-source arm (64505-64514), which
  is the 7.5 B8 head-rebuild item; this slice supplies its
  instantiateSignatureInContextOf dependency (75910-75924,
  compareTypes = Assignable default until 7.5 passes the
  relation-frame worker). Frontier pin records the oracle-probed
  flip target. applyToParameterTypes/applyToReturnTypes gained
  STATE-LEVEL twins per the 7.2d decision (walker copies stay
  hard-bound).
- **Intra-expression recording sites** (74010/74206/74387) landed
  with the raw pre-optionality member types, PropertyAssignment →
  initializer node mapping, and the JSX attributes context node.
- isInferencePartiallyBlocked stays constant-false: all three tsc
  producers (46681/46909/46920) are services-API wrappers; the
  resolveCall debug_assert survives 7.4.

**7.4 review fixes (2026-07-20, same branch):** the deferred-node
containment test gained its THIRD signal — a containment-reverted
Vacant is now recorded (`contained_call_resolutions`) at
getResolvedSignature's Err unwind, so the benign mid-fixpoint clear
(77505 `: cached` on a loop-dirty fresh frame) no longer co-triggers
the skip under an unrelated enclosing range — and the ancestor walk
resolves JSX CHILDREN through JsxElement.opening_element /
JsxFragment.opening_fragment (the slot lives on the OPENING node, a
sibling subtree of the children; the direct JsxOpeningFragment
listing was leaf-dead) plus the BinaryExpression instanceof slot.
getTypeArgumentsFromNodes threads isInJSFile(node) (76931) into its
getDefaultTypeArgumentType padding (any in JS — dormant until
checkJs/M8, the 76821 twin). addImplementationSuccessElaboration's
probe now seeds AND writes back resolveCall's live argCheckMode (tsc
restores only the three error-candidate vars, 76746-76761). Comment
debt: the four "production passes None until 7.4" residues updated;
68647's isNoInferType disjunct noted at infer_from_middle_slice
(NoInfer rides Substitution types — M8 widens the guard).

## Stage 7.5: consumers cleanup [M]

Ripple sites that were declared-type-only until now: contextual
tuple/array element inference in literals, generic
constructor/`new` inference, tagged templates, JSX element type
resolution's call path, `satisfies` interplay, and the
2769 failure-path candidate choice (getCandidateForOverloadFailure
with real instantiated candidates). Previously owned here (the M3
code markers said M6; no other milestone scheduled it) and LANDED
EARLY at 7.2c: `isValidBigIntString` (18973) for bigint
template-literal placeholders —
isValidTypeForTemplateLiteralPlaceholder's bigint arm is live and
its structural.rs escape retired (the annotation-literal full-radix
`parsePseudoBigInt` half landed earlier still — M4-review A14,
slice 1). Nothing of it remains for 7.5. Also owned here (escaped at M5 6.4f with owner="M6";
scheduled in no earlier stage — the M5 post-close review flagged the
missing doc backing): `compareTypePredicateRelatedTo` (64606) + the
compareSignaturesRelated predicate arm (64577-64592, incl. the
1224/1226-family reporting) — retire structural.rs's
`type_predicate_signature_relation_gate` with it. Decision table to
restore (M4-review B7 — the gate over-contains three of four cells;
its escape reason is accurate only for the both-sides cell; verified
against 64575-64591): related path — the predicate arm sits inside
!ignoreReturnTypes AND after the void/any-target early return;
compareTypePredicateRelatedTo runs ONLY when BOTH sides carry
predicates; target-only: an identifier/this predicate reports the
1224 family and fails, an asserts-form target alone falls through
silently; source-only is a plain return-type comparison (a predicate
signature's return type is boolean); identical path —
compareTypePredicatesIdentical when either side carries one but ONLY
inside !ignoreReturnTypes; every ignoreReturnTypes cell (union
matching, callback pre-gates) consults no predicate at all. The three
port gate sites carry matching notes.

Also here (M4-review B8): rebuild compareSignaturesRelated's HEAD in
tsc order — its instantiateSignatureInContextOf dependency LANDED at
7.4c (instantiate.rs, Assignable-default compareTypes; this stage
passes the relation-frame worker and flips the 7.4c higher-order
frontier pin to its oracle face) — tsc
(64487-64514) decides same-reference identity, the top-signature
pair, and sourceHasMoreParameters arity BEFORE generic instantiation,
where the port's early gate contains all of it; make
signature_related_to honor its erase parameter via the live
get_erased_signature (erased sides carry no type parameters, retiring
most of the gate's fire surface); and add signaturesRelatedTo's
same-target-reference PAIRWISE arm (instantiations of one reference
target compare index-to-index, never N×M). The stale inline cite
"66727-66730" at the gate was corrected to 64505-64514 (slice 5).

Re-probe the M4 NOTES top-10 list; retire entries this milestone
fixed.

Commit: `m6 7.5: inference consumers (+rate)`.

**7.5 decisions of record (2026-07-21, m6/7.5-consumers; slices
7.5a B7, 7.5b B8, 7.5c consumers/docs):**

- **B7 landed exactly as tabled** *(amended 7.5d: as tabled for the
  ANNOTATED predicate family — the probes never covered tsc 6.0.3's
  body-INFERRED predicates (getTypePredicateFromBody, TS 5.5), whose
  relation-side absence produced the 7.5d overload-fabrication FP;
  see the 7.5d block below)* — all four related-path cells and
  the identical-path consult oracle-probed before porting
  (scratchpad probe75*.mjs; 25+ rows). Two probe surprises recorded:
  the asserts-form-target "silent fall-through" cell is in practice
  decided EARLIER by the void-target return (64577-64579) since asserts
  signatures return void; and a source-only ASSERTS predicate
  compares as `void` (not boolean) in the plain return comparison —
  b7_source_only_asserts pins the 2322. Reporting cells
  (2518/1224/1226/1227 chains) ride T2 as elsewhere.
- **Verdict pinning under the display curtain**: relation-failure
  heads whose args are function types don't render in the 5.4 slice
  (statement containment), so False-verdict pins ride the
  @ts-expect-error band THROUGH check_program (driver-level 2578
  synthesis + the S8 partial-check exemption): [] = the verdict is
  False OR the statement Err-contained (S8 exempts the directive), so
  a [] pin proves NOT-wrongly-True; only the 2578 direction is strict
  — (2578,…) ⟹ fully checked, zero rows, verdict True *(amended
  7.5d: the original "iff" overclaimed the False direction)*. A 2578
  control pin proves the mechanism; checked_rows-level tests can NOT
  see this band.
- **B8 head rebuild**: tsc order restored (same-ref → top-signature
  → arity → instantiate); the generic arm runs getCanonicalSignature
  (new canonical_signature_cache, write in the 7.0t assert net +
  should_panic twin) + iSICO. tsc's compareTypes parameter =
  CompareTypesFn::RelationFrame; the isRelatedToWorker CLOSURE is
  modeled as a **frame loan** (engine.rs RelationFrame): the walker
  mem::takes its frame fields around the state-level iSICO call and
  the constraint clamp re-assembles a RelationChecker per compare —
  live maybe-stack/budget participation, mutations restored, captured
  intersectionState honored. *(Amended 7.5d: the loan is PARKED on
  `CheckerState::relation_frame_loan` for the whole iSICO call, not
  threaded as a parameter — the original `_with_frame` faces missed
  the re-entrant getInferredType resolutions through the non-fixing
  mapper's deferred thunks and panicked on forward-referencing
  constrained generics; see the 7.5d block below.)* Consuming
  RelationFrame with no parked loan is a panic invariant (iSICO's
  context is frame-local; nothing re-reads it after iSICO returns).
- **Worker intersectionState restoration**: compareSignaturesRelated's
  internal comparisons (this-types, params, strict-arity probe,
  returns — 7 sites) passed IntersectionState::NONE where tsc's
  compareTypes2 closure captures signatureRelatedTo's
  intersectionState; restored with the rebuild (corpus green,
  FP=0).
- **Erase + pairwise**: signatureRelatedTo applies getErasedSignature
  per side (comparable-band success pinned via the 2578 face);
  signaturesRelatedTo's same-symbol/same-target pairwise arm indexes
  i-to-i with a hard assert on list lengths (tsc Debug.assertEqual —
  which throws in SHIPPED tsc too; upgraded from debug_assert at
  7.5d);
  tsc's `undefined === undefined` symbol pair (both symbol-less
  instantiated) is preserved as None == None.
- **Display-slice extension is FP-shielded**: "{}" renders ONLY for
  symbol-LESS empty anonymous objects. The bare arm unmasked 5
  corpus fabrications (2339/2322 in exportAsNamespace5 /
  declarationFileForJsonImport / jsObjectsMarkedAsOpenEnded) whose
  member machinery is M7/M8 — the symbol guard re-shields them and
  is documented at the arm as load-bearing FP shielding, not display
  fidelity. The 7.4c frontier pin FLIPPED to its oracle face
  [(2322,148,1)] ('{}' vs 'number' args from the noLib Array miss);
  two recorded-FN pins (calls.rs array-literal 2345, widen.rs 7053)
  flipped to oracle rows the same way.
- **Ripple audit: nothing left to build** — the consumer list
  (contextual element inference, generic new, tagged templates,
  satisfies, 2769 failure-path candidate choice) probed 11-for-11
  port==oracle (probe75f/probe75g); representative pins added.
  7.4's resolveCall inference had already carried the mass; 7.5's
  B7/B8 closed the relation-side remainder.
- **M4 NOTES re-probe recorded in docs/NOTES-m4.md**: 2454/18050/
  18048 RETIRED (M5 delivered); 2345 349→236 and 2322 1362→1006
  (M6 delivered); M7/M8-owned rows byte-stable; 2365's M5/M6 owner
  guess falsified → amended M7-adjacent.
- Old stub-era pin generic_signature_relations_escape_to_inference
  rewritten to assert the live verdict (alpha-equivalent generics
  relate).

**7.5d review fixes (2026-07-21, m6/7.5-consumers — external review
of PR #47; two blockers + one major, all corpus-blind, all
counterexamples oracle-verified against vendored 6.0.3):**

- **Frame loan re-park (blocker — panic)**: `<T extends U, U extends
  string>(x: T, y: U)` related against a concrete function type
  PANICKED at the RelationFrame dispatch — slot T's constraint
  instantiation re-enters slot U through the non-fixing mapper's
  DEFERRED thunk mid-iSICO, where the parameter-threaded loan could
  not reach (tsc's closure is ambient; getInferredType 69296-69298 →
  makeNonFixingMapperForContext 68258-68278 → forward getInferredType
  → clamp compareTypes). Fix: the loan PARKS on
  `CheckerState::relation_frame_loan` (engine.rs RelationFrameLoan);
  the clamp takes/puts it around each compare; a RE-ENTRANT compare
  DURING an in-flight clamp walk (lazy member resolution of an
  object-typed constraint resolving a forward slot) finds the
  InFlight marker and runs a fresh sub-walk under the recorded
  relation/intersectionState — a recorded deviation from tsc's
  shared maybe-stack/budget (aliasing-impossible in Rust; bounded by
  the pre-clamp memo). The `_with_frame` parameter faces are gone.
  Pinned both re-entry shapes, pass and fail faces.
- **Body-inferred predicate guard (blocker — FP)**: the B7 consults
  read "no materialized predicate" as predicate-free, but tsc 6.0.3
  INFERS predicates from unannotated boolean-returning bodies
  (getTypePredicateFromBody, TS 5.5) — probed: a body-inferred
  source against a predicate-annotated overload hard-Falsed
  candidate 1 and FABRICATED a renderable 2322 off candidate 2
  (tsc: clean); the override-compat 2416 went missing; the plain
  assignment mis-verdicted behind the curtain. Fix: the RELATED arm
  and the CALLBACK cell ride narrow.rs
  relation_type_predicate_of_signature, which Errs when the
  narrowing-side probe (signature_may_have_body_inferred_predicate —
  unannotated + boolean return + params, the same class the
  get_effects_signature escape defers) flags a None — containment,
  new escapes row (owner M6, joining the close-line adjudication).
  The IDENTICAL tail deliberately keeps the raw consult: guarding it
  Errs every union/intersection signature-list assembly over
  unannotated boolean members and kills their calls' REAL rows
  (pinned by multi_signature_body_inference_candidate_flags_the_
  query) — the residual one-sided-inference over-match is recorded
  at the site as a KNOWN-GAP (list-shape divergence, no proven
  fabrication). Annotated-predicate cells and plain boolean helpers
  stay live.
- **isInstantiatedGenericParameter (major)**: the callback cell's
  second suppression disjunct (64549-64550 —
  `signature.target`'s position type is generic pre-instantiation,
  75871-75874) was missing since M4, mis-routing instantiated
  same-shape methods through the callback recursion (probed:
  `I<(x: string) => void>` → structurally-matching plain interface
  related False-then-contained where tsc is clean; the
  same-reference face is shielded by variance shortcuts). Ported
  isInstantiatedGenericParameter + its isGenericType /
  getGenericObjectFlags dependencies (indexed.rs, next to
  getSimplifiedType; composite memo elided — append-only tables —
  and the Substitution arm is an M8 escape like its neighbors).
- Hard assert on the pairwise arm (shipped tsc throws too); the
  canonical should_panic twin warms the identity instantiation so it
  pins the CANONICAL cache assert, not the instantiations-map one;
  silence pins for the B7/B8 live cells upgraded to
  rows-and-partials (containment-blind no more); stale citations
  (64570→64577-64579, 64550→64551, 67068→67070) and the widen pin's
  phantom "6133 ×2" oracle claim corrected.

## Stage 7.6: close tails (landed 2026-07-21, PR #48 @546167ff)

The close adjudication's implementable retirements — every
dependency had landed in earlier slices:

- `typeof f<...>` instantiation expressions: the TypeQuery face of
  checkExpressionWithTypeArguments (60602 → 77963) over the already-
  ported getInstantiationExpressionType; three designed-dead arms
  activated (node stamp 77999 on the deferred_node slot,
  getObjectTypeInstantiation declaration selection 63464,
  instantiateAnonymousType node-carrying copy 63649-63651 — the
  MAPPED half of the unconstructible assert stays). +7 corpus rows
  (+5 2xxx), parserTypeQuery8 fully matched, FP=0.
- getReducedType never-consult in reportNonexistentProperty: the
  "unported" justification was STALE (E4 landed 59287-59297 — the
  recurring watch-pattern). The consult reduces the WHOLE declared
  type: only a whole-type collapse to never reproduces tsc's own
  lookup failure (oracle-pinned); a union that merely CONTAINS
  never-reduced cross-product members reduces to its survivors in
  tsc (getReducedUnionType) — the per-member version broke a live
  pin (probe_discr) and was corrected before landing. Residual
  narrowing-divergence shield re-owned M8.
- Synthetic-spread silent iteration walk: producer enumeration
  proves the non-array-like synthetic face unconstructible from
  well-formed variadics (VARIADIC elements are array-like in tsc too
  — isTypeAssignableTo vs `readonly any[]` through the grammar-
  forced constraint). tsc-shape walk kept; residual re-owned M8.
- getTypePredicateFromBody LIVE (79020-79074): tsc's double-write
  pre-seed (59785-59786) mirrored as the pre-seeded None memo — the
  re-entrancy shield; synthetic TrueCondition/FalseCondition heads
  COMPOSE as antecedent-walk + one getTypeAtFlowCondition step in
  one query (the binder arena is immutable to the checker — recorded
  deviation, pinned); getEffectsSignature back to tsc shape (the
  uncertain-flag machinery, its query threading, and the probe all
  retired). Corpus byte-neutral — the family was corpus-blind
  exactly as the 7.5d review measured; 7 containment-era pins
  flipped to live oracle-probed rows (the 2416 override row emits at
  its exact position; the M5 post-close D1/D2 seam reverts are
  gone). this-parameter face probed: tsc yields no usable predicate
  past a leading `this:` (the declaration-list index keys past
  signature.parameters) — port row-identical, pinned.

## Close — decisions of record (2026-07-21)

**The "T0 ≥ 58%" line is superseded.** It was calibrated before the
oracle-correction epoch (PR #19: totals became 49024/21051) and the
A5 family freeze (PR #24). The convergence plan owns close
semantics: C4 closes milestones "on its A5 family rows and
canaries, never the aggregate 63% calibration point", and
landing-order row 9 schedules the 2XXX sweep deliberately AFTER M6.
Close arithmetic (main @546167ff, T0 54.8813% = 26905/49024, FP=0
all bands): the FN mass 22,119 partitions exactly into
M7 families 16,903 (unused 14,613 / checker-grammar 1,352 /
suggestion 641 / flow-derived 149 / program-resolution 148) +
2xxx band 4,733 (phase-9) + implicit-any 268 (M6-owned family) +
M8 196 + M5 residual 21. Reaching 58% needs +1,536 matched rows;
the entire M6-ownable mass is 268 — arithmetically unreachable
inside M6 scope, so the aggregate line closes as superseded and M6
closes on content.

**implicit-any residual (FN=268) adjudication** (M5 precedent:
flow-strict-nullability closed at FN=21): 149 rows ride
checkJs/jsdoc-salsa fixtures (M8 band — 98 on
jsdocTypeFromChainedAssignment3 alone), 39 ride parserharness.ts
(RealWorld cascade), 80 scattered element-access/binding faces
whose 7053 emitter is live (matched 15/88 family-wide).

**Escape dispositions** (14 owner=M6 rows at 7.5 → 0 at close):

- Implemented at 7.6: typeof-typeargs; both getTypePredicateFromBody
  rows (3 sites); never-reduction consult (narrowed M8 residual);
  synthetic-spread walk (narrowed M8 residual).
- DELETED with constructibility disproof: both DeferredType arms
  (getTypeOfSymbolWithDeferredType / getWriteTypeOfSymbolWith-
  DeferredType) — `CheckFlags::DEFERRED_TYPE` has NO writer in the
  port (createUnionOrIntersectionProperty computes eagerly, a
  documented perf-cache divergence); guard note at the flag
  definition demands the arms return with any future writer.
- Re-owned M7 (phase-9 sweep dependencies): check.rs contextual
  tuple arity + intersection display + tuple renderer (212 boundary
  hits — the largest single curtain, structurally renderable);
  elaborateArrayLiteral forceTuple (4×2322 hits); computed-key
  destructuring (12 hits, all on the unused-family fixture).
- Re-owned M8 (shields with evidence): generic-residue rest
  narrowing net (fixed/unfixed/type-variable probes all
  port==oracle — an Inferential-phase shield only); assertion-stash
  seam (ZERO production begin_speculation sites exist — the 7.0t
  transaction is machinery-complete but unadopted; survive-set
  decision recorded at speculate.rs::rollback_speculation).

## Final gate (re-adjudicated at close)

```sh
cargo xtask ci               # full gate — green at close
cargo xtask escapes --stale M6   # zero owner=M6 rows (223/0/0/116)
cargo xtask ledger check     # zero M6-stub entries (retired at 7.4b)
```

M6 closed on content: C3 scope (7.0t transaction + 7.1-7.6) fully
landed and merged; owner=M6 escapes zero at STAGE=M6; A5 canaries
green; FP=0 all bands.

## Expected failure modes

| Symptom | Diagnosis | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Literal type args where oracle widens (or inverse) | widen-literals condition simplified | The condition is FOUR clauses (checker-key §2.1); port, don't paraphrase |
| Callback parameter types wrong only in overloads | re-run skipped or run against the un-instantiated candidate | Re-run uses the SAME InferenceContext, NORMAL mode, then re-instantiates (checker-key §3.2) |
| 2345 fixed but new 2322 downstream | inference result leaked into caches during a failed candidate | Candidate probing must not write links (speculation_depth discipline, greenfield §4.3) |
| Constraint violations infer `never` where oracle keeps part | ReturnType-priority FILTER branch missing | getInferredType clamp has three outcomes, not one |
| Context-sensitive arg checked twice with different types | isContextSensitive classification diverges | Port the tsc predicate; it gates the whole two-pass scheme |
